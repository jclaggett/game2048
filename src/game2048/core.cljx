  "I'd like to define a 2048 component.
  Steps towards that goal:
    1. defrecord with all the state needed by this component including
       any subcomponents.
    2. Use only functional subcomponents: all functions must act as
       updaters or getters.
    3. Mark state that needs to be immutable.")
